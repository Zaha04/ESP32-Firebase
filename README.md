# ESP32-Firebase
 Small demonstration of how we can connect ESP32 with Firebase to create a simple parking system where we can detect which parking lot is free or occupied using the sound signals from and ultrasonic sensor for Arduino/ESP-32.
 The results are sent automatically in the NONSQL database at an interval and this code will overwrite the existing records to not fill the storage in the database with new records.
